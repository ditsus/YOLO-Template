# YOLO-Template

While attempting to learn the basics of OpenCV, I decided to create a simple template for YOLOv5 to identify objects through the webcam. 

Run ```pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/yolov5/refs/heads/master/requirements.txt``` to install the necessary packages, then run the .py file.
